<h1>Zion National Park <h2>
<ul>
<li> The park is named after the Hebrew word, “Zion.” The park is located in Utah. This word translates as “a place of peace and relaxation.” </li>
<li> In Zion National Park there is an area called Weeping Rock.  In this area, the water that can be seen oozing from the rock surfaces has taken more than 1,000 years to travel through the stone from its source in a natural, underground spring.
<li> One of the word’s largest freestanding natural arches is located in Zion’s backcountry.  Kolob Arch measures about 287 feet in length. </li>
<li> Some trails to visit in Zion include Angel's Landing, a strenuous to the top of a rock formation, and the Narrows, a 16 Mile Trail (though you don't need to hike the whole trail) through a river in a canyon. </li>
